1 - What is the main difference between univariate and multivariate linear regression, in terms of variables?
There's multiple variable taken into account for the multivariate linear regression

2 - Is there a minimum number of variables needed to perform a multivariate linear regression? If yes, which one?
yes, 2. Otherwise it's univariate

3 - Is there a maximum number of variables needed to perform a multivariate linear regression? If yes, which one?
no

4 - Is there a difference between univariate and multivariate linear regression in terms of performance evaluation?
We compute the prediction from a larger theta array,
but the cost formula only use y and y_hat, making it unchanged

5 - What does it mean geometrically to perform a multivariate gradient descent with two variables?
we are going through 3 dimensions (theta0 add a dimension),
and the result of the gradient gives a 4th dimension
It makes it difficult to have a geometric representation
